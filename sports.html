<h1>Green shines as Suns thump Clippers</h1>
<p>Published on November 7, 2025 · By <strong>ABS-CBN News | SBB Sports Desk</strong></p>
<img src="jelen.png" width="450" height="450"> <p>Jalen Green made a triumphant season debut for the Phoenix Suns on Thursday, scoring 29 points in a dominant 115-102 NBA victory over the short-handed Los Angeles Clippers.</P>
     <p>
      "It felt good to be back," a beaming Green said in an on-court interview. "I was telling everybody on my team, I was like I couldn't even take my nap fully I was so anxious to get back on the floor.</p>
     <p>
      The Suns, trailing by three after a tight first half in which the lead changed hands 11 times, exploded with 40 points in the third quarter, making their first eight shots of the period and pushing their lead to as many as 20.</p>
     <p>
      Devin Booker added 24 points as the Suns, a disappointing 0-4 on the road, improved to 4-1 at home.</p>
     <p>
      Ivica Zubac led the Clippers with 23 points and 11 rebounds, but the absence of Los Angeles' two top scorers, Kawhi Leonard and James Harden, was too much to overcome.</p>

      Alas Pilipinas Girls showed promise in the 2nd Asian Volleyball Confederation (AVC) Asian Women's U16 Volleyball Championship, but their spirited run came to a halt. </p>
     <p>
      “It's a bit disappointing because we really prepared for this game, but it didn't turn out the way we hoped,” said Rayco. “Still, we're grateful because we gave our best despite what happened.”</p>
     <p>
      “The team's energy kind of died down,” said Alas coach Edwin Leyva. “I told them that volleyball is a game of emotion and momentum. When we're happy and communicating, that's when we play our best. Unfortunately, our energy dropped during crucial points. Some of the younger players were also dealing with minor aches, but overall, they performed really well. We just came up short.”</p>

      Leo Mhar Lobrido, who comes from the proud Vicera boxing family that has produced Olympians, puts his loss in the Asian Youth Games in Bahrain into perspective</p>
     <p>

     <p>
      Lobrido dominated Jordan's Salte Al Hadidi in the preliminary, then beat Sri Lanka's Binul Dulnada Dewasiri Narayana in the quarterfinals to guarantee himself a medal.</p>
     <p>
      “The loss means that I still have to do more training and apply the things I lack. Maybe next time I'll win gold,” said Lobrido, who also served as the Philippines' flag bearer in the opening ceremony together with volleybelle Harlyn Serneche.</p>
